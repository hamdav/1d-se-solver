Controls: 

- Draw while holding down the mouse button to draw a potential
- Q calculates the bound states for the potential 
	(and also fixes the potential so that its a valid function)
- C clears everything (except energy scaling)
- J and K increases / decreases the energy scaling respectively,
	effectively increasing / decreasing the depth of the potential.
	They also automatically trigger a recalculation of the bound states.
- Up / Down arrows show the above / below wavefunction
